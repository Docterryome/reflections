When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you have multiple people working on the same project, it's a lot easier to manage to get the work from a central place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might be working on something really big that does not need to go to the repository right away, and somebody could have made a change on the file that you are working on and pushed it to the repository which might interfeare with what you are trying to do.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks clones one repository to another repository in git hub it is use when you want to take somebody's project and remix it and make it your own, you would use a clone if you are trying to take your repository from git hub, or local and making anoter copy of it. Branches are used to do a unique thing on a project, or make a diffent version of the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	So you have the latest changes inside your repo without it affacting your work or you commiting unfished changes inside the github repo.
